# Data Science in production project setup

As presented (or will be presented ;) ) in the class, for the DSP course you'll have to setup an ML powered application that is composed of the following components:

- Model as a service
- User interface
- Scheduled prediction job
- Scheduled data ingestion pipeline (data quality validation, ...)
- Monitoring dashboard for the model predictions and ingested data
- Model re-training pipeline (bonus)

As a reminder, here is an illustration of some of these components and how they should interact with each other:

</p>

You can find detailed explanation of the different components [here](0_project_instructions.md).

## Assignment instructions
For this assignment you need to submit a **PDF document** with:

1. Your **group name AND member list** (the group specifications were defined in the class)
2. A description of your project subject with the following information:
   - The chosen use case (energy conception prediction, ...): **the dataset should include at least 3 data types (string, numeric, boolean, ...)**
   - The **link** and **description** of the dataset you'll be using for the use case.
   - A list of the columns categorized by type (*string*: col1, col2, ...., *numeric*: col3, col4, ...)
   You should not submit the dataset itself but a link

**Only the group representative should make the submission**
