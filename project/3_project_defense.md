# Defense

For the DSP project defense, each group will have **25 min**, during which you will be:

1. Presenting your use case and your project architecture (~2 min)
2. Demonstrating the developed features (~13 min)
3. Q&A & code review (10 min)

**Note**:

- For the presentation, you need to include a checklist of the developed and non-developed features
- In the demonstration of the data ingestion pipeline, make sure to ingest data with poor quality so that you can demo
  the data validation with *great_expectations*
- In Q&A section, you may be asked system design questions. For example, "if we want to add this feature, what changes
  you may need to make in the current architecture"

**Deliverables**:

1. Github repository with a well documentation README.md (installation steps, etc): needs to be submitted before the
   defense (in the assignment form)
2. The presentation PDF slides: needs to be updated in the DSP teams channel after the defense
